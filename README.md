# Dash-Projects
Personal projects completed in the Dash by General Assembly course

**Project 1: Build Your Own Personal Website**

Got a refresher on the h1, body, style, and title tags. For the final project I
added a photo of myself, replaced the background photo, and incorporated lots of
purple! Also used a few things I learned in freeCodeCamp such as rounding the
border of the photo and adjusting its size.
